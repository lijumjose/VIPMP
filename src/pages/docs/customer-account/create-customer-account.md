# Create customer account

Before placing an order, a reseller needs to create a customer account by using the Create Customer Account API:

| Endpoint | Method|
|---|---|
|/v3/customers| POST|

The API returns the customer resource with a link to the [Get Customer Account Details](get-customer-account.md) endpoint.

## Usage instructions

Ensure that you are aware of the following before creating a customer account:

* Customer account ID is created by this API and returned synchronously.
* The customer payment instrument is managed on the partner marketplace.
* `cotermDate` is usually calculated when a customer’s first order is placed.
  * Most subscriptions, except for Stock Credit Packs, will end or renew on the `cotermDate`.
* Use `cotermDate` in your request to create an extended-term customer. For all market segments except EDU, the `cotermDate` can be set to a date that is more than 1 to 3 years from the current date. For EDU customers, the term can be extended up to 4 years from the current date.
* Use `externalReferenceId` to pass it to the marketplace’s Customer ID.
  * Optional and does not need to be unique.
* `Contacts` specifies admins for the customer's account and receive an admin welcome email.
  * Contact names for existing email addresses cannot be changed. If you send a different name for an existing email, that name will be returned in the synchronous response, but it will not persist in the system. The existing first and last name of the contact will be used and returned in any GET calls.
* The successful _Create Customer_ call returns a customer with status 1002 (Pending) while the final validation happens asynchronously. The account may then become active or inactive. Pending customers can place orders, but they may not update their accounts using the _Update Customer_ API until the account becomes active or inactive. All orders placed for a pending customer fail if the customer becomes inactive.
* `discounts` contains a list of objects with the customer’s discount levels for each `offerType`.
* Customers can be created with a specified market segment.
  * Reseller must be enabled for that market segment.
  * If no market segment is specified in the request, the customer becomes part of the commercial (COM) market segment by default.
* The `benefits` array must include the `LARGE_GOVERNMENT_AGENCY` indicator for LGA customers.
