# Manage reseller accounts

As a first step to enable VIP - Marketplace, the marketplace presents Adobe Terms and Conditions to a reseller. If the reseller accepts the Terms and Conditions, the marketplace creates an account for the reseller. You can use the following APIs to manage reseller accounts:

* [Create a reseller account](create-reseller-account.md)
* [Get reseller account details](get-reseller-account.md)
* [Update a reseller account](update-reseller-account.md)
* [Get reseller list](get-reseller-list.md)
