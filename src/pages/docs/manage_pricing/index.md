# Access Price Lists

Partners can leverage the `Fetch Price List` API to retrieve up-to-date pricing information for Adobe products. This API not only modernizes Adobe’s price list distribution process but also delivers several key advantages:

- **Real-time pricing access**

  Partners can retrieve available price lists programmatically to always work with the latest version of VIP Marketplace price lists, ensuring accuracy and reducing delays.

- **Historical pricing support (3YC)**

  The API provides access to historical pricing, including Three-Year Commitment (3YC) prices. This is essential for serving customers with price-locked agreements.

- **Comprehensive global coverage**

  Partners can access current price lists across all products, countries, and currencies.

## Fetch Price List API

| Endpoint      | Method |
|---------------|--------|
| /v3/pricelist | POST   |

**Sample request URL:** `POST <env root url>/v3/pricelist?offset=0&limit=10`

The `POST /v3/pricelist` API retrieves the price list information for the partners.

### Integration Guide

Partners will receive email notifications whenever updates are made to the Price List. Upon receiving the notification, partners can initiate a request to the Fetch Price List API by following the steps below:

1. Initiate API request

   Use the `POST /v3/pricelist` API. The request must include required parameters, with optional filters available to refine the response. See [Request](#request-body) for the complete list of supported parameters.

2. Handle API errors

   If the API returns an error, refer to the [Error Handling](#http-status-codes) section for guidance on interpreting and resolving error codes.

3. Parse the response

   The API returns a JSON response. Partners should parse this response and process the data outlined in the [Response](#response-body) section.

4. Pagination support

   The API supports pagination. Refer to the pagination guidelines to understand how to navigate through paged results efficiently.

5. Store Price List data

   Partners are expected to store the Price List data in their internal systems. Key attributes to store include:

   - `offerId` – Unique identifier for the offer; required when placing orders through [Order](../order_management/create_order.md) APIs.
   - `productFamily` – Helps categorize and group offers that belong to the same product family.

   Additional attribute details are available in the [Response](#response-body)  section.

6. Track Price List changes

   To identify changes to the Price List, review the following fields:

   - `acdIndicator`: Indicates whether the offer is new, changed, or deleted.
   - `acdEffectiveDate`: The date on which the acdIndicator status was set.

### Query parameters

You can use the query parameters such as `limit` and `offset` in the request URL. For example: `POST <env root url>/v3/pricelist?offset=0&limit=10`

| **Field**                        | **Required** | **Type**           | **Description** |
|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `limit`            | No           | Integer            | Specifies the number of items to be returned per page, enabling pagination. The default value is 20.|
| `offset`       | No           | Integer            |  Specifies the starting point for retrieving items in a paginated list. It determines how many items to skip before beginning to return results. If not specified, the default value is 0, meaning the response will start from the first item. |

|----------------------------------|--------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| `region`                         | Yes          | String (Enum)      | Specifies the region for which the Price List should be returned. This must be one of the regions supported for the Partner. The following region codes are supported: <br /> AP, JP, WE, LA, MX, EE, PA, NA  |

| `filters`                        | No           | Object             | Filters to narrow down the Price List. All filters use AND logic. For example, if `offerId` and `productFamily` filters are included in the request, then API the response will include results that match `offerId` AND `productFamily` |

### Filter

You can refine the data returned in the response by using the filters property in the request body. This allows you to narrow down the price lists based on specific criteria. All filter fields are combined using AND logic, meaning that only results matching all specified conditions will be returned if multiple filters are applied. Filters with null or empty values will be ignored. You can filter the data using the following parameters:

- `offerId`
- `productFamily`
- `firstOrderDate`
- `lastOrderDate`
- `discountCode`

### Define offer data to be displayed in the response

To customize the offer details returned in the response, use the `includeOfferAttributes` parameter in the request body. This allows you to specify which offer attributes should be included in the response.  For example:

- `productType`
- `productTypeDetail`
- `language`

**Notes:**

- The response will include only the attributes listed in `includeOfferAttributes`, plus these default attributes:

  - `totalCount`
  - `limit`
  - `offset`
  - `offers`
  - `offer → offerId`
  - `offer → discountCode`
  - `offer → productFamily`
  - `offer → firstOrderDate`
  - `offer → lastOrderDate`
  - `offer → partnerPrice`
- Any request parameter that has no value is omitted from the response.

## Response body

**Disclaimer – Offer Attributes in Response**

- When using the `includeOfferAttributes` parameter in the request, the API will attempt to return the specified attributes for each offer. However, it is not guaranteed that every offer in the response will contain all the requested attributes.
- The availability of each attribute depends on the underlying data applicability and validity for the specific offer. If an attribute is not relevant or does not have a valid (non-null) value for a given offer, it may be omitted from that offer’s attribute section in the response.
- Requesting all available `includeOfferAttributes` does not ensure that all attributes will be present for every offer. Consumers of the API should design their integrations to handle missing or null attribute values gracefully.
