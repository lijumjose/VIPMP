# Manage customer accounts

A reseller can create and manage a customer by using the following APIs:

- [Create Customer](create_customer_account.md)
- [Get customer](get_customer_account.md)
- [Update Customer Account](update_customer_account.md)
- [Get customer list](get_customer_list.md)

Once a customer account is created, the reseller can [place an order](../order_management/index.md) in the marketplace.
