# Manage market segments

Market segmentation is an internal convention used to inform the internal stakeholders about the product or business intent to have one or more of the following differentiations:

- **Price range** \<br /\>The price range available for a product. Pricing for the Education segment is typically lower than that for the Commercial pricing.
- **Product certification** \<br /\> Certification required for product. For example, education-ready and Government-ready software and services must meet more stringent Adobe legal, safety, privacy, and trust requirements.
- **Purchasing qualification** \<br /\>
    Customers are typically required to prove their association with government-related agencies or educational institutions to buy the product at a different price range. For individuals buying education plans on Adobe Direct, Adobe verifies their education status with a third-party identity verification service.

These are the three market segments available for Adobe products:

| Value | Description                 |
|-------|-----------------------------|
| COM   | Commercial \<br /\> (default) |
| EDU   | Education                   |
| GOV   | Government                  |

The education market segment mentioned in the above table is further divided into K-12, higher education, and non-profit, as listed in the following table:

| Value      | Description                               | Offers available to purchase                                                    |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| K_12       | K-12 School (Primary or Secondary School) | - EDU offers without a sub-segment.  \<br /\> - EDU offers with K-12 sub-segment. |
| HIGHER_ED  | Higher Education Institution              | - EDU offers without a sub-segment. \<br /\> - EDU offers with HED sub-segment.   |
| NON_PROFIT | Nonprofit Organization                    | - EDU offers without a sub-segment.                                             |

**Note:** The Additional Detail (Column P) in the price list file contains information on the sub-segment of an offer and the minimum purchase quantity, if applicable.

- If the offer has a sub-segment, the Additional Detail text begins with that subsegment (K-12 or HED).
- If the offer has a minimum purchase quantity, the Additional Detail text ends with that information.

**Example Additional Detail**: K-12 Shared Device Site Education License Lab and Classroom (100+)

- This offer is associated with the K-12 sub-segment and has a minimum purchase quantity of 100.

## Market segment workflows

The following market segment workflows are available:

1. Set market segments for resellers

   - Reseller market segments can be set as part of a create or update request.
   - A reseller’s market segments may be changed at any point, but removing a market segment may cause future orders or renewals to fail.
   - All existing resellers with no market segment can be initialized with only the COM market segment.
   - API endpoints for managing this workflow:
     - [POST Create Reseller API](../reseller-account/create-reseller-account.md)
     - [PATCH Update Reseller API](../reseller-account/update-reseller-account.md)

2. Set market segment for customers

   - Customer market segment can be set as part of a create or update request.
