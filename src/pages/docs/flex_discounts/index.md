# Manage Flexible Discounts

The Flexible Discount feature enables partners to easily adjust product prices, making them more attractive to different customer segments. These discounts are primarily intended to boost customer retention or acquisition. You can access details about the flexible discounts available for a product in a specific market segment and country, and apply them while placing an order or when creating or modifying a subscription.

Key advantages of flexible discounts include:

- **Discounts to drive new product adoption:**

  - Provides selective discounts for enterprise accounts to encourage early adoption of new products.
  - Helps facilitate faster market penetration.

- **Quick flexible discount launches for seasonal sales:**

  - Allows partners to activate discounts within days for timely seasonal discounts like Black Friday.

## Flexible discount types

The following three types of flexible discounts are available:

1. **Percentage Discount (% discount):** A percentage reduction is applied to the base price of the product.
2. **Fixed Discount ($ discount):** A fixed monetary reduction is applied to the base price of the product.
3. **Fixed Price:** Offers a product at a fixed price, regardless of its original price.

The discounts applied based on these discount types are explained in the following tables:
