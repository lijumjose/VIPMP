# Create order

Use the `POST /v3/customers/<customer-id>/orders` endpoint to place an order for a customer. Read more about [scenarios where an order is created](order-scenarios.md).

## Assumptions

Ensure that you are aware of the following before creating an order:

- `orderType` is required in the Create Order request.
  - Possible values are: NEW, RETURN, PREVIEW, PREVIEW_RENEWAL, or RENEWAL
  - See [Order Scenarios](./order-scenarios.md) for request and response samples for each order type.
- `subscriptionId` is mandatory in lineItems for:
  - `orderType` RENEWAL
  - `orderType` PREVIEW_RENEWAL if lineItems are present
- `referenceOrderId` is required for RETURN orders and should not be included for other order types.
- For `RETURN` orders that reference a `NEW` or `RENEWAL` order, you can now return a quantity that is less than the original line item quantity, within 14 days of the original order. The requested quantity is validated against the line item’s current `remainingQuantity` value on the original order. See [Return or cancellation of order](order-scenarios.md#return-or-cancellation-of-order) for details on eligibility, exclusions, and error codes.
- `currencyCode` should now be sent at the lineItem level instead of  the order level.
  - For backward compatibility, `currencyCode` can still be sent at the order level.
- The `discountCode` is applicable only to High Volume Discount customers who have migrated from VIP to VIP Marketplace. You can use the discount code only if their discount level in VIP is between 17 and 22.
- `flexDiscountCodes` can be used in the request to apply Flexible Discounts for customers who meet the eligibility criteria. For additional details, see [Managing Flexible Discounts](../flex-discounts/apis.md).
- Do not send an Adobe Instant Deal Registration code or ID. Adobe evaluates eligible line items automatically, independently of whether `flexDiscountCodes` is present.
  - When `fetch-price=true`, a qualifying response line item includes `earnedDealRegPerUnit` and `earnedDealRegAmount` in `pricing`, and `pricingSummary` includes `totalEarnedDealRegAmount`. These deal registration amounts remain separate from existing partner-price fields.

**Notes:**

- See [Order Scenarios](./order-scenarios.md) for request and response samples for each order type.
- See [Order resource](../references/resources.md#order-top-level-resource) for descriptions for each request and response parameter.
- `isDealRegistered` is included only when Instant Deal Registration was auto-injected for a line item. If the field is absent, Instant Deal Registration was not injected or evaluated. A value of `false` means qualification failed; `true` means qualification passed. No amount fields are returned when the value is `false`.
