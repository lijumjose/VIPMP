# Manage orders

Orders can be created either through the Sandbox UI or Commerce Partner API calls. Each order creates a single subscription, along with its corresponding subscription ID.

**Note:** To create a Preview Order and Return Order, use the _Order Preview_ and _Create RETURN Order_ API calls from the presets.
